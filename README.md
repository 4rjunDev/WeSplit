This application is a bill splitter which tells the user the amount of money each person owes, taking into account the tip percentage, when the bill is split evenly among people. The user is prompted for the bill amount, the number of people and the tip percentage. The app displays the total bill amount with the tip percentage selected by the user, and the amount per person based on the number of people inputted by the user.
